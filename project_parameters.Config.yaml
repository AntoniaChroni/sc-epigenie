metadata_file: "project_metadata.tsv" # Options: "project_metadata.tsv" (default) or name as user wants. It needs to be in `tsv` format. It can include one or more samples, as long as it contains at least the following columns in this exact order: `ID`, `SAMPLE`, and `FASTQ`. The `ID` column must contain unique values. Additional metadata columns can be added and arranged as needed by the user (though not required). For samples with multiple technical replicates, list all associated FASTQ file paths in the same row, using commas to separate each path.
