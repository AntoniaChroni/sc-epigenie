root_dir: "/sc-epigenie" # Absolute path to the main dir of the project where GitHub repo lives
data_dir: "/sc-epigenie/analyses/cellranger-analysis/results/02_cellranger_count/DefaultParameters" # Absolute path to data dir of the project with CellRanger output results. Options: "DefaultParameters", "ForcedCells8000Parameters", or else. 
metadata_dir: "/data/project_metadata" # Absolute path to metadata dir of the project.
metadata_file: "project_metadata.tsv" # Options: "project_metadata.tsv" (default) or name as user wants. It needs to be in `tsv` format. It can include one or more samples, as long as it contains at least the following columns in this exact order: `ID`, `SAMPLE`, and `FASTQ`. The `ID` column must contain unique values. Additional metadata columns can be added and arranged as needed by the user (though not required). For samples with multiple technical replicates, list all associated FASTQ file paths in the same row, using commas to separate each path.
genome_name: "GRCm39" # define genome reference and versioning. Options: (1) human: "GRCh38" and "hg19"; and (2) mouse: "GRCm39", "mm10", and "mm9".

# the following parameters are set up as default values and/or are specific for the following modules:

# Define the sample ID prefix(es) used in this project.
# Sample IDs should follow a format like: PREFIX001 (e.g., DYE001, ABC002).

# Initially, we use a list of multiple resolutions and then we run the module again with the single resolution that fits the data best. 
# If no list is provided, then it will calculate the clusters by the default list.
# We recommend to run first default and then explore a customized list of resolutions (if these are not provided in the list already).
# In the latter case, user needs to comment in/out the `resolution_list_default_clustering_module` accordingly.
resolution_list_clustering_module: NULL # This can be a single or multiple resolutions or NULL (default), e.g., NULL; [0.5]; [0.1, 0.5, 1]

top_n_value_peaks: 1 # Number of top peaks per cluster to plot. Start with top_n_value = 1 to quickly generate results and check if the plots look good. If you want deeper analysis and have time/resources, increase to 3 or more. Often 3 is a good balance between thoroughness and efficiency - top_n_value = 3 (or higher) means you plot more peaks per cluster.
